Chicken Crossing - Don't worry about the why, just get to the other side

For my video game, I opted for a 2-D platform genre. As a fan of the Super Mario franchise myself, I drew inspiration from it for the gameplay physics. When I my work on the game began, I was new to Javascript and did not know how to generate images using it. As such, I relied on the tutorial provided below, using it as an initial template. This served as an important foundation to my progress as I had tremendous success with building on top of the initial script and modifying it to make it my own.

As a platform game, there were multiple variables that needed to be accounted for when developing this game. The biggest hurdle I faced was with the horizontal collision physics, and having them work alongside the horizontal scrolling mechanism. The game also has a vertical scrolling mechanism, and there are instances where either or both mechanisms are disabled.

The level-building itself was relatively straightforward, the complexity lay with having to use multiple conditions so that the functions used would work on all the levels where they are required (the map sizes and array lengths varied).

Towards the end of the development came the introduction of images and scenery to enhance the immersive experience of the game. You won't find any of those images on any search engine, as they were all custom-drawn by yours truly on Paint.NET. It was at this stage where I added an opening screen, as I found it unprofessional to the game to spit the player right into the level as soon as the page loads.

The game script may be long and complex, may not make the most efficient utilisation of JavaScript's features, however I used whatever was available to me to complete the job. In hindsight, I am pleased with the finished product, and take great pride in my accomplishment, considering that this is my first Javascript game.
